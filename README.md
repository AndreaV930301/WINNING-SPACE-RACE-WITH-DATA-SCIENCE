WINNING SPACE RACE WITH DATA SCIENCE- Final - AV

This is the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate capstone project presentation.

It should be noted that compared to typical high-level and abstracted presentations for executive teams, this one is far more thorough and technical.

In order to follow the Data Science methodology, which includes data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting results to stakeholders, I pretend to be a Data Scientist working for a startup hoping to compete with SpaceX.

We will forecast whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully in this capstone project. SpaceX promotes Falcon 9 rocket flights on its website at a cost of 62 million dollars; alternative suppliers charge up to 165 million dollars per launch. A large portion of the cost reductions are attributable to SpaceX.
